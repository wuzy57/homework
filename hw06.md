### 5、使用维基百科，解释以下概念： CPU、RAM、ROM、Bus (computing)、Parallel Computing

answer:cpu：A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry； Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement Read-only memory, a type of storage media that is used in computers and other electronic devices； In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols； Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors；

### 6、写一段文字，简单解释“云计算（cloud computing）”

answer:云计算（cloud computing）是基于互联网的相关服务的增加、使用和交付模式，通常涉及通过互联网来提供动态易扩展且经常是虚拟化的资源。云是网络、互联网的一种比喻说法。过去在图中往往用云来表示电信网，后来也用来表示互联网和底层基础设施的抽象。因此，云计算甚至可以让你体验每秒10万亿次的运算能力，拥有这么强大的计算能力可以模拟核爆炸、预测气候变化和市场发展趋势。用户通过电脑、笔记本、手机等方式接入数据中心，按自己的需求进行运算。 对云计算的定义有多种说法。对于到底什么是云计算，至少可以找到100种解释。 现阶段广为接受的是美国国家标准与技术研究院（NIST）定义：云计算是一种按使用量付费的模式，这种模式提供可用的、便捷的、按需的网络访问， 进入可配置的计算资源共享池（资源包括网络，服务器，存储，应用软件，服务），这些资源能够被快速提供，只需投入很少的管理工作，或与服务供应商进行很少的交互。

### 7、小孙买了计算机主板，说明书表明“支持双通道DDR3-1333内存， 最大支持16G 1）DDR3内存，“3”和“1333”的含义是什么? 2）小孙买8G DDR3-1600的内存能提高性能吗？ 3）小孙买4G*2 DDR3-1333的内存能提高性能吗？ 4）16G需要多少位地址？ 备注，维基百科（中文）“DDR3 SDRAM”

answer:①DDR3是一种计算机内存规格。它属于SDRAM家族的内存产品，提供了相较于DDR2 SDRAM更高的运行效能与更低的电压，是DDR2 SDRAM（同步动态动态随机存取内存）的后继者（增加至八倍），也是现时流行的内存产品规格；1333指的是内存频率；
       ②不能； 
       ③能； 
       ④34
