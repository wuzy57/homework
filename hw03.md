### 1.Method of complements
---
In mathematics and computing the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers； 

### 2.Byte
---
The byte (/ˈbaɪt/) is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many compute are known to have been used in the past. The modern de-facto standard of eight bits

### 3.Integer (computer science)
---
In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer；

### 4.Floating point
---
In computing, floating-point arithmetic is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times. A number is, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the significand) and scaled using an exponent in some fixed base；
